# Contributing

Hey, thanks for contributing to the app! You can do so by submitting bugs, feature
requests or coding. If you are creating a new issue, please take a look at the existing
ones first to make sure it's not duplicated.

When submitting a bug please try to include a screenshot or video whenever possible.

Before submitting any code please open an issue with your idea so that we can
agree on an approach for it. Be explicit if you want to work on it.

If you want to work on an existing open issue, please claim it, by adding a comment to the issue,
before working on it so that there isn't overlap of efforts.

Then you can fork and create a pull request against the `master` branch.

Thanks!
