# TODO

This tracks pending tasks and ideas for the app

- [ ] Needed to fork @shoutem/ui to set the StatusBar color. Once this [pull request](https://github.com/shoutem/ui/pull/386) is merged we can switch back to upstream.
- [ ] react-native-fit-image: waiting for [open PR](https://github.com/huiseoul/react-native-fit-image/pull/81) to be merged and published, for now using my own release.
- [ ] [react-native-iap](https://github.com/dooboolab/react-native-iap) is pinned at version 3.0.2 because on 3.1 it migrated to Androidx, which isn't compativle with Expo. [This issue](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/2956) is tracking androidx support (planned for SDK 35 or 36)

Wishlist:

- [ ] Add support for gear builder
- [ ] Add support for Random Settlement event
  - [ ] Consider Settlement events from expansions
